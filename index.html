					<p>Rain is probably the most common weather pattern on this list. Rain occurs when
                        there is too much moisture in clouds for them to hold on to, the ground and
                        cloud temperatures are above freezing, so rain is in a liquid state. There
                        are three different types of rain, there is classic rain which is typically
                        0.02 inches or greater in diameter. There is drizzle which is any rain less
                        than 0.02 inches in diameter. Lastly there is Virga, virga is when the rain
                        is so small that it does not even reach the ground before evaporating.</p>

					<p>Snow is basically the opposite of rain. Snow occurs when the ground and cloud
                        temperatures are under the freezing point of water. Snow might look like a
                        fluffy, fun to play in type of weather but if you’re a driver this type of
                        weather could be very dangerous. In the event of snow thawing and a flash
                        freeze happens overnight ice could make the roads very slick. There is also the
                        possibility of a blizzard. These massive snow storms could result in you being
                        snowed in to your house.</p>

					<p>Sometimes when rain is on it’s way down to the ground it comes across a layer of
                        freezing air which can freeze the raindrops and form varying sizes of
                        hailstones. These hailstones will then fall to the ground in place of
                        the raindrops even if the ground temperature is above freezing. Hail is a
                        common part of severe summer thunderstorms. Hail causes roughly one billion
                        dollars in damages a year across the United States, and falls at speeds of up
                        to <span>120</span></p>

					<p>The root cause of most tornadoes is rapidly rotating thunderstorms known as
                        supercells. Visible columns of air extended from the both of the storm is
                        called a funnel cloud. Funnel clouds only become tornadoes when the funnel
                        cloud makes contact with the ground. Tornadoes are considered to be pretty
                        dangerous because they have the power to tear down buildings and rip trees
                        and the roots straight out of the ground. Tornadoes are different categories
                        based on their wind speeds. An EF-0 is a tornado that has wind speeds of <span>65</span>
                        to <span>85</span>. An EF-1 has wind speeds of <span>86</span> to <span>110</span>. The EF-2 tornado has wind
                        speeds of <span>111</span> to <span>135</span>. An EF-3 tornado has wind gusts of <span>136</span> to <span>165</span>.
                        The EF-4 tornado has wind gusts of <span>166</span> to <span>200</span>. Lastly the rarest tornado
                        the EF-5 has the strongest wind gusts of over <span>200</span>. If you ever encounter
                        a tornado get to a place that can’t be moved, this could be a storm cellar
                        or just a room in your basement with cement walls such as a furnace room.</p>

					<p>The term hurricane is only used for tropical storms that form over the Atlantic
                        Ocean or Eastern Pacific Ocean. The generic, scientific term for these types of
                        storms is actually tropical cyclone. For a tropical cyclone to form it requires
                        warm ocean water. This means that tropical cyclones can only form above
                        tropical regions where the temperature of the water is at least 80 degrees
                        fahrenheit. The second ingredient for a tropical cyclone is wind. The storm is
                        officially a hurricane when wind speeds reach <span>74</span>. Like tornadoes there are
                        different categories of hurricanes. There is a Category 1 where wind speeds are
                        between <span>74</span> and <span>95</span> and damage is usually minimal. Then there is a Category 2
                        where the wind speeds are normally between <span>96</span> and <span>110</span> and damage is
                        moderate. A Category 3 has wind speeds of <span>111</span> to <span>129</span> damages are expected
                        to be extensive. Category 4 hurricanes typically have wind speeds of <span>130</span> to <span>156</span>
                        mph damages in a Cat 4 are usually extreme. Lastly is the Category 5 hurricane
                        wind speeds are <span>157</span> mph or higher damages in a Cat 5 are expected to be
                        catastrophic. If you encounter a hurricane stay indoors because the high wind
                        speeds can blow objects around causing hazard to you. If ever told to evacuate
                        do so immediately.</p>
